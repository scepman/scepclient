# scepclient

A .NET SCEP client

Can be used to extend [SCEPman](https://www.scepman.com/) to easily distribute Kerberos Authentication certificates to AD Domain Controllers instead of only certificates for end-user devices.

## Prerequisites

The .NET Core version requires the [.NET Core 3.1 Runtime](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/3.1). You need only the simple runtime, Desktop or ASP.NET may be used, but are not required.

There is also a version for .NET Framework 4.6.2 available that runs directly on Windows Server 2012 R2 and newer.

## Usage

### Domain Controllers

See the [SCEPman documentation](https://glueckkanja.gitbook.io/scepman/scepman-configuration/optional/domain-controller-certificates) for a detailed description of how to request Kerberos Authentication certificates for Domain Controllers.

### Custom Certificate Requests

You can submit customized CSRs with the `gennewext` command. This allows you to define any number of DNS entries in the Subject Alternative Name (SAN) extension and any Extended Key Usages. 

#### Extended Key Usages

You can add any Extended Key Usage by its OID value. The following Extended Key Usage values can be added as text:

- AnyExtendedKeyUsage
- ServerAut 
- ClientAuth
- CodeSigning
- EmailProtection
- IpsecEndSystem
- IpsecTunnel
- IpsecUser
- TimeStamping
- OcspSigning
- SmartCardLogon
- MacAddress

#### Example: gennewext

Create a file dnslist.txt with the following content:

```
servername1.example
servername2.example
servername3.example
```

Create a file keyUsages.txt with the following content:

```
ServerAuth
ClientAuth
```

Execute the following command:

```
ScepClient.exe gennewext http://scepman.server/static SeCrEtPaSSwOrD dnslist.txt keyUsages.txt "Great Server" greatserver.pfx greatserver.cer
```

### Debugging

The sub commands `gennew` and `submit` can be used to debug a SCEP service. Just execute scepclient.exe without any parameters to see usage information (and do not get irritated by the exception, it does no harm).
